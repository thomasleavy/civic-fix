# Landing page videos (required for hero video)

Pexels does not allow direct embedding from other sites (403), so the app only uses local files. Add these two files here (not in the repo due to GitHub’s 100 MB limit):

- **landing-page-video.mp4** — [Stunning aerial sunrise over Irish cityscape](https://www.pexels.com/video/stunning-aerial-sunrise-over-irish-cityscape-28824280/) (Jays Photography)
- **landing-page-video-2.mp4** — [Aerial footage of a town surrounded by scenic natural landscape](https://www.pexels.com/video/aerial-footage-of-a-town-surrounded-by-scenic-natural-landscape-2386450/) (Kelly)

Download from the Pexels links, rename to the names above, and place in this folder. Without them, the hero area will show a broken video (no console errors from Pexels 403 once local-only is used).
