# Landing page videos

Place these files here (they are not in the repo due to GitHub's 100 MB file limit):

- `landing-page-video.mp4`
- `landing-page-video-2.mp4`

You can use free stock videos from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/search/videos/civic%20engagement/) or similar. The app will cycle between them on the `/civicfix` landing page. If the files are missing, the video area will simply not display a source.
