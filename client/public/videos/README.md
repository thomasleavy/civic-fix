# Landing page video (optional for local; fallback URL used on live site)

One video is shown on the landing page, credited to **Keppy** (Pexels: https://www.pexels.com/@keppy/).

- **Locally:** Add `landing-page-video.mp4` here if you want to use your own file (e.g. from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/search/videos/)). If the file is missing, the app tries a remote URL so the video can still play.
- **Live site (gh-pages):** No local file is deployed (size limit). The app uses a remote video URL so the hero video can play on https://thomasleavy.github.io/civic-fix/.
